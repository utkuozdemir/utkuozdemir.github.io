# CV

My CV resides here.  
It is based on the [posquit0/Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) project.  

I decided to take its files in instead of forking it or adding it as a submodule, 
because the project looks not maintained anymore, and required some fixes to build on my PC.

## How to build

To build:

```bash
$ xelatex utku.tex
```

It will build the file with name `utku.pdf`.
