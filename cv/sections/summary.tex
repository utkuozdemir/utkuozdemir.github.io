\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I am a software and infrastructure engineer living in Berlin
    with over 7 years of hands-on \& team leading experience.
    \newline
    I enjoy building robust, scalable software and taking ownership on the whole lifecycle.
    \newline
    With my experience on both on backend application development and Cloud/DevOps,
    I am a strong supporter of "you build it you run it" philosophy.
    \newline
    During the last 2 years, my main focus area is infrastructure, particularly Kubernetes,
    containerization and building private cloud solutions.
    \newline
    I also have extensive experience and up-to-date knowledge on building backend software
    using JVM languages, mainly Java and Kotlin.
