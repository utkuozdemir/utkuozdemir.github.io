\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I am a software and infrastructure engineer living in Berlin
    with over 10 years of hands-on development, operations \& team-leading experience.
    \newline
    I enjoy building robust, scalable software and taking ownership of the whole lifecycle.
    \newline
    During the last few years, my main focus area is infrastructure, particularly Kubernetes,
    containerization and building private cloud solutions.
    I am also very interested in the Go programming language and the cloud-native ecosystem.
    I am the creator and the maintainer of a few open-source projects in those areas.
    \newline
    I have contributions in various open-source projects both voluntarily and as part of my work.
    \newline
    I also have extensive experience and up-to-date knowledge on building backend software
    using JVM languages, mainly Java and Kotlin.
