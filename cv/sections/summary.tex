\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

    I'm a software and infrastructure engineer living in Germany,
    and I've got over a decade of hands-on experience in development, operations, and team leadership.
    \newline
    I really enjoy building robust, scalable software and taking ownership of the entire development cycle.
    \newline
    Lately, my main focus has been on infrastructure, particularly Kubernetes, containerization,
    and developing tools in these areas.
    I'm also a creator and maintainer a few open-source projects in these domains.
    \newline
    I've contributed to various open-source projects both voluntarily and as part of my work.
    \newline
    In addition to my current pursuits, I also have a strong background
    in building backend software using JVM languages, particularly Java and Kotlin.
    I like to stay updated on the latest developments in these languages
    and technologies out of personal interest.
